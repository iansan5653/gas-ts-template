# Google Apps & TypeScript Project Template

This repository provides a simple template to start a new
[Google Apps Script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script) project with TypeScript. Building, linting,
formatting, and pushing to Google Apps are all built in.

The project is set up with a TypeScript configuration that transforms your TypeScript files in the `src`
directory into JavaScript files in the `build` directory. It's not enough to upload those files as-is to
Google Apps, however, because Apps Script doesn't support installing and running dependencies, and uploaded
files are run in random order - they aren't linked together at all. To solve this problem, a second build step
uses Webpack to combine all files and depdendencies into a single minified `Code.js` file, which is the only
file that is actually pushed to Google Apps.

## Getting Started

1. Click ["Use This Template"](https://github.com/iansan5653/gas-ts-template/generate) to start a new
   repository. Clone your new repo and open a terminal in the local directory. This template includes some
   configuration for VSCode, but you can use any editor.
2. Ensure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is installed on your system, then install all of the dependencies
   by running `npm install`. Alternatively, start a Codespace in your new repository and dependencies will be
   installed automatically.
3. Start a new Google Apps Script project by going to https://script.google.com/home and clicking **New
   project**. You can also start a project tied directly to a specific Google Apps file by opening the file
   and clicking **Tools** -> **Script Editor**.
4. Click the gear icon in the Google Apps Script editor sidebar. Copy the **Script ID**.
5. Replace `SCRIPT_ID` in [`.clasp.json`](./.clasp.json) with your project's ID. This ID is _not_ a secret -
   you can safely commit it to your repository.
6. Write your TypeScript code in the `src` folder. Note that `index.ts` is the entrypoint for your project.
   Only what is imported into the `index.ts` file will be compiled into the script.
7. Optional: lint your code with `npm run lint` and/or auto-format your code with `npm run format`. Typically
   you will want to install the ESLint and/or Prettier extensions in your preferred code editor.
8. Deploy your code to Google Apps:
   - **Manually**:
     1. Log in to Google Apps Script by running `npm run login`. Make sure to use the same account you used to
        make the Google Apps Script project. You only need to do this once.
     2. Compile the TypeScript files into a single JavaScript file and push it to Google Apps by running
        `npm run deploy`. Run this every time you make changes.
   - **Automatically**: You can configure GitHub Actions to automatically deploy your code every time you push
     it (or every time you create a new release). This is advantageous because you can be sure your repository
     will always have the same code that is deployed to Google Apps. However, Google's Clasp tool is not
     designed to authenticate in CI environments and so this takes some more complicated setup and isn't
     included in this template by default. One option for this might be
     [`ericanastas/deploy-google-app-script-action`](https://github.com/ericanastas/deploy-google-app-script-action).

## Available Scripts

You can run the following scripts by opening the project directory in your terminal (as long as you have Node
& npm installed):

- `npm install` Install all required dependencies.
- `npm run build` Build your project to ensure it compiles properly.
- `npm run format` Format your code automatically using Prettier.
- `npm run lint` Check your code for common errors using ESLint.
- `npm run login` Login to the Google Apps Script client so you can push/pull. You will need to run this once
  on each device you use.
- `npm run pull` Fetch the latest changes from Google Apps Script. You should only need to do this if you
  change the project settings.
- **`npm run push` Build your project and push it to Google Apps in one step.** The first time you run this,
  you will be prompted to log in to your Google account. This command will automatically update any test
  deployments.
- `npm run deploy` Build and push your code, then create a new versioned
  [deployment](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/concepts/deployments).

You can also run any [Clasp command](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/clasp) with
`npx clasp <command>`.

## Automated GitHub Workflow

The template comes with a built-in configuration file for
[GitHub Workflows](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows). The workflow is
configured to run on every push to the `main` branch as well as on every Pull Request as a Check, and it
simply checks the code to ensure that it passes linting and is buildable (has no type/syntax errors). This is
known as _continuous integration_ and provides a form of automated testing to ensure that your project's code
is always valid.

For larger projects where more than one developer will be collaborating, it is reccomended to protect the
`main` branch and only allow changes to it through Pull Requests in which all checks pass. You can learn more
about this from GitHub's
[help articles](https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/about-protected-branches).

If you would like to disable the workflow, simply delete the [`checks.yml`](./.github/workflows/checks.yml)
file.

## Development Notes

The following notes have important information for writing code for Google Apps Script using this template.
Please read through them before you start.

### **_Important_**: Exposing Functions to Google Apps Script

In order for your Google Apps to run any of your code, you'll need to expose one or more functions to the
engine. In the traditional Google Apps Script environment, you'd do this by declaring global functions,
however in this setup there is no concept of 'global' as all files are modules.

Instead, only functions exported from `index.ts` will be available to Google Apps Script. Any function
exported from `index.ts` will be accessible by all
[triggers](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/triggers) and anywhere else Google Apps might need
to call your function, such as from a [custom menu](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/menus).

Due to [a bug](https://github.com/iansan5653/gas-ts-template/issues/2) in the Webpack plugin, only exports in
`export {...}` form are supported:

```ts
// ❌ Does NOT work
export function bad1() {
  /* ... */
}

export const bad2 = () => {
  /* ... */
};

// ✅ Does work:
export { good1 } from "./good1.ts";

function good2() {
  /* ... */
}
const good3 = () => {
  /* ... */
};

export { good2, good3 };
```

Examples for all the simple triggers are given in [`index.ts`](./src/index.ts).

For cleaner, more usable code, it may be useful to reference functions by their `name` property instead of
hardcoding the name into code. For example:

```ts
const createButton = CardService.newTextButton().setText("Create").setOnClickAction(
  // Here we use `onClickCreateEvent.name` instead of hardcoding `"onClickCreateEvent"`
  CardService.newAction().setFunctionName(onClickCreateEvent.name),
);
```

### Circular Dependencies

Circular dependencies (files that depend on each other in a circular manner) can cause unexpected issues like
"X is not a function" or "X is not defined". If you are seeing these errors in your project and you know they
are wrong, try checking for circular dependencies using [`madge`](https://github.com/pahen/madge) (not
included in this template):

1. Install `madge` globally with `npm i --global madge`.
2. Check for circular dependencies with `madge src/index.ts --circular`.

## Included Files

  - `workflows` All GitHub workflows are configured using YAML files in this directory.
    - `checks.yml` This is where the continuous integration workflow is configured.
- `src` This is where you'll put all your TypeScript files.
  - `example.ts` Gives an example of how to export something from a local file.
  - `index.ts` Provides you with the five basic triggers prebuilt, as well as an example of how to import from
    a local file.
- `.clasp.json` Provides the configuration for Clasp, the command-line tool which pushes code to Google Apps
